:::{admonition} Open an issue
If you find a problem or have a suggestion when using this Jupyter Book (on physics, statistics, python, or formatting), from any page go under the github icon <img src="_images/GitHub-Mark-32px.png" alt="github download icon" width="20px"> at the top-middle-right and select "open issue" (you may want to open in a new tab by *right-clicking* on "open issue"). This will take you to the Issues section of the Github repository for the book. You can either use the title already there or write your own, and then describe in the bigger box your problem or suggestion.

## Brief guide to online Jupyter Book features

* A clickable high-level table of contents (TOC) is available in the panel at the left of each page. (You can close this panel with the left arrow at the top-left-middle of the page or open it with the contents icon at the upper left.) 
    :::{admonition} Searching the book
    The "Search this book..." box just below the title in the TOC panel is a great tool.     Try it! (And enhancements are expected in the near future as the Jupyter Book project matures.)
    :::
* For each section that has subsections, a clickable table of contents appears in the rightmost panel.
* On pages that are not generated from Jupyter notebooks, the three icons at the top-middle-right will put you into full-screen mode; take you to the github repository for the book or let you open an issue (see the top of this page); or show you the markdown source (.md) of the page or generate a pdf version of the page.
* On pages generated from Jupyter notebooks, there is an additional icon at the top-middle-right (leftmost), which enables you to run the notebook on a cloud server using [Binder](https://mybinder.org) ([Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) may be available later). When running on Binder, be patient; it may take a while to generate the page if the environment needs to be created from scratch (in general it is cached, so it will be much faster if others have been recently using notebooks from the repository).
