    "A Jupyter notebook is displayed on a web browser on a computer, tablet (e.g., IPad), or even your smartphone.  The notebook is divided into *cells*, of which two types are relevant for us:\n",
    "* Markdown cells: These have headings, text, and mathematical formulas in $\\LaTeX$ using a simple form of HTML (language of webpages) called markdown.\n",
    "* Code cells: These have Python code (or other languages, but we'll stick to Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "Either type of cell can be selected with your cursor and will be highlighted in color when active.  You evaluate an active cell with shift-return (as with Mathematica) or by pressing `Run` on the toolbar.  Some notes:\n",
    "* When a new cell is inserted, by default it is a Code cell and will have `In []:` in front.  You can type Python expressions or entire programs in a cell.  How you break up code between cells is your choice and you can always put Markdown cells in between.  When you evaluate a cell it gets the next number, e.g., `In [5]:`.\n",
    "* On the menu bar is a pulldown menu that lets you change back and forth between Code and Markdown cells.  Once you evaluate a Markdown cell, it gets formatted (and has a blue border).  To edit the Markdown cell, double click in it. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Try double-clicking on this cell and then shift-return.**  You will see that a bullet list is created just with an asterisk and a space at the beginning of lines (without the space you get *italics* and with two asterisks you get **bold**).  **Double click on the title header above and you'll see it starts with a single #.**  Headings of subsections are made using ## or ###.  See this [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for a quick tour of the Markdown language (including how to add links!).\n",
