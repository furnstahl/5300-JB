# Bibliography

This is a partial list of good references.

The textbook will be John R. Taylor, [Classical Mechanics](https://library.ohio-state.edu/search/i?SEARCH=189138922), ISBN 1-891389-22-X. We will not be covering every section but the course will follow the book in large parts and reading and problem assignments will be given from the book.

There are many books on Python programming and using Jupyter notebooks.  We will supply references elsewhere.  Of particular interest for our topic is (although our treatment will be more advanced):

* Anders Malthe-Sorenssen, [Elementary Mechanics Using Python](https://library.ohio-state.edu/search~S7?/aMalthe-Sorenssen/amalthe+sorenssen/1%2C1%2C2%2CB/frameset&FF=amalthe+sorenssen+anders&2%2C%2C2) [click on SpringerLink for a downloadable pdf]
